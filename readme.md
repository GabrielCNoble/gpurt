A small gpu raytracer based on Peter Shirley's Raytracing In One Weekend book. This raytracer traces triangles (and spheres, naturally) with 1spp. There's no denoiser in place, no fancy sampling techniques, and no spectacular brdf is being used. This is just all machinery to run a simple fragment shader, which does all the job. The results doens't look terrible though.
